2.	Enter the setup_Windows folder. Run "STEP1-install_anaconda" by double-clicking on it.
- SKIP THIS STEP IF YOU ALREADY HAVE ANACONDA INSTALLED ON YOUR MACHINE

4. Double click to run setup_auto_update.bat

- The auto update feature relies on Git. Please download Git through [this link](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if it hasnâ€™t been installed.

## Update Instructions

There are two ways of updating to the newest NLP Suite version.

1. Double click update.bat on your local machine every time you want to get new/changed files from GitHub.
2. Double click on setup_auto_update.bat and, from then on, when exiting the NLP Suite new/changed files will be automatically pulled from GitHub. You only need to run setup_auto_update.bat once.

## Run Instructions
The Windows installation script creates an NLP Suite desktop icon. Double click the NLP_Suite icon on your desktop to run the Suite.
 
## Shortcuts
Run the add_shortcut.bat file by double clicking it. This will add a shortcut to your command prompt that will allow you to type nlp and automatically be placed into your NLP Anaconda environment as well as in your NLP Suite Directory. You can remove the alias this script creates by running the remove_shortcut.bat.

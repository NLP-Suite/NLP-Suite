# Setup instructions for Windows:

1. Unzip the zip file to a location

2. Go to the extracted folder

3. Run "STEP1-install_anaconda" by double-clicking on it.
    - SKIP THIS STEP IF YOU ALREADY HAVE ANACONDA INSTALLED ON YOUR MACHINE
    - If you'd like to skip this step, make sure you have Anaconda in $PATH. One way to check is to type conda in a command-line window, press enter, and see if there is an error.
4. Run "STEP2-install_components" through right-click -> run using Powershell

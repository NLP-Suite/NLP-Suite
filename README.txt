NLP Suite

Once you have downloaded and installed the NLP Suite, anywhere on your machine, goto the setup_Mac or setup_Windows folder (depending upon your machine) and run STEP1 (for Anaconda and Python) and STEP2 (for all Python and Java files in the NLP Suite). Also read the readme_Mac.txt or readme_Windows.txt (again, depending upon your machine) for further instructions.
